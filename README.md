# Blockfreight, Inc. ERP

### Quickstart ###

1. Edit docker-compose.yml with right parameters according your needs:
```  
   DEFAULT_HOST: "erp.blockfreight.com"
   VIRTUAL_HOST: "erp.blockfreight.com"
   LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "erp.blockfreight.com"
   LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL: "SET_AN_EMAIL_TO_GET_LETS_ENCRYPT_WARNINGS"
   POSTGRES_USER: "ofbiz"
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "ofbiz"
   OFBIZ_DB: "ofbiz"
   OFBIZ_OLAP_DB: "ofbizolap"
   OFBIZ_TENANT_DB: "ofbiztentant"   
```   
2. Be sure POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, OFBIZ_DB, OFBIZ_OLAP_DB and OFBIZ_TENANT_DB are same both in ofbiz and postgresql block.
3. Start everything running:
```
    docker-compose up -d 
```    
4. Wait a bit and then you can access everything from the domain you provided in parameters. By default it redirects to SSL.
5. Postgresql is persisting data in volume pgdata. Of course a proper backup policy for DB is needed
